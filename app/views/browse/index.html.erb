                            Welcome to the Hillel Haim Lab at University of Iowa. The lab is led by Hillel Haim, Assistant Professor of Microbiology in Carver college of Medicine, University of Iowa. Our research examines the physiological bases of both normal and abnormal visual processing. Using behavioral (psychophysical), electrophysiological, and imaging techniques, we study the vision of both normal individuals and patients with diseases of the retina or ganglion cell/optic nerve.

                                    Well, many of the computational tools we created are inspired by concepts from non-biological systems (and mostly from mathematical finance). Common to most is the presence of a dominant random variable that guides change. Accordingly, we treat the evolution of virus properties (simple or complex) as a process of diffusion.
