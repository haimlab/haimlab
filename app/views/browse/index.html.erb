                          Viruses apply an array of mechanisms to resist inactivation by antibodies, allowing them to persist in the host and spread through the population. The ability to change the structure of their proteins by mutations allows them to escape antibody recognition. Viruses can also evade antibodies by masking conserved elements on their surface proteins and by modulating their stability. Two complementary research programs in our lab combine computational and molecular tools to improve our understanding of these mechanisms and to design strategies to overcome the challenges they pose for vaccine design.

                                    Well, many of the computational tools we created are inspired by concepts from non-biological systems (and mostly from mathematical finance). Common to most is the presence of a dominant random variable that guides change. Accordingly, we treat the evolution of virus properties (simple or complex) as a process of diffusion.
